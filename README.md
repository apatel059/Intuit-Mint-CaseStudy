## Overview and  Origin:

Intuit Mint formerly know as mint.com is a subsidiary of Intuit Inc., headquartered in California, USA. It is a personal finance management service provider through web and mobile application. The application helps users manage their finances by bringing all transactions from accounts -checking, savings, retirement, investments etc in one place as well as helps in building budgets, credit score and more.  

The company was initially founded by internet entrepreneur Aaron Patzer in early 2006 and was launched in September 2007 for the US and Canadian markets. According to Aaron Patzer, the idea of mint.com came from his frustration of spending hours every month on tools like Microsoft Money and Quicken for entering, categorizing and analyzing his spendings and investments. 

The company raised total of 31M in venture capital fund from DAG Ventures, First Round Capital, Ram Shriram, Shasta Ventures and Sherpalo. Executives from companies like eBay, Yahoo, Google, Charles Schwab, Wilson Sonsini, Reuters, Adteractive and Weblogic/BEA also invested in mint.com. Later, on September 14, 2009 mint.com was bought by Intuit Inc. for approximately $170 million. During the acquisition mint.com was America’s #1 online personal finance providers with over 1.5 million users. Just within two years of its launch, mint.com was tracking nearly $200 billion in transactions and $50 billion in assets and had successfully identified more than $300 million in potential savings for its costumers.

## Business Activities:

According to Aaron Patzer, the main reason he introduced Mint was to solve complexity in managing and understand personal finance without the need of routine maintenance or accounting knowledge. It is a tough task for most to pull all information together from different bank accounts, credit cards, investments, retirement plans, credit scores and much more in one place on monthly basis, and to understand it is even harder. 

Mint application is one stop solution to all personal finance management needs. It automatically pulls all banks, credit union and credit card transactions and categorizes expenses for users to easily understand where they are spending their money, credit balances and interest rates. It alerts users for unusual spendings, low balances, upcoming bills (recurring subscription, monthly fixed payments) and also helps users find ways to increase savings by searching low cost credit cards and bank account deals, identifies hidden costs from investment advisor/brokers through its portfolio and investment tracking tools, helps avoid late payment fees with payment tracker, and builds realistic budgets based on average spending patterns by category. Furthermore, the application shows and also helps improve user’s credit score by continuously monitoring for new credit alerts from TransUnion, all for free. Mint works on freemium business model. It generates revenue via referrals, advertisement, sale of user data and premium account option.

According to company’s April 2016 blog post, Mint had more than 20 million customers. With emerging developments in fintech, it has become more crucial than ever to keep track of our finances to make money work for us. It can be anticipated that this number has only grown larger ever since with more than 160 million people using online banking in year 2019 to keep track of their finances. Statistically, on average Americans own more than four bank accounts, which makes it practically impossible for them to understand complete overview of their spendings and balances. As per Markets Insider, the U.S. personal finance software market size is projected to reach $343 million by 2026, registering a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 5% from 2019 to 2026. According to Business Insider, PFM solutions are particularly attractive to younger consumers as 70% of millennials have no personal relationship with a banker, 78% never go to a bank branch and about 53% of US spend no time managing their finances – opening doors for companies like Intuit Mint to unlock a huge opportunity if they can incentivize "unengaged" consumers. 

There are tons of financial planning applications available these days like YNAB, Personal Capital, Acorns but these apps are more geared towards savings and investments. However, Mint’s refreshing value proposition brings in easier and more valuable solution to a problem millions of Americans struggle with everyday. It provides real time, effortless and comprehensive picture of its user’s spendings as well as offers intelligent, personalized suggestions to save and earn more money. Mint Bills, Mint’s bill-pay tracker is one of the handy features that looks like a bank bill pay system where users can track recurring obligations, add payees and also customize email notification system for as many bank accounts you allow. Plus it’s all free and secure makes its more attractive.

Unlike other personal finance management providers, Mint is backed up by Intuit Inc., Intuit’s ecosystem is compared to Apple’s ecosystem by many for accounting systems. Intuit established its reputation in the 1990s by defeating Microsoft in the race to become the standard for financial software. Though fintech has changed drastically since the company's establishment in 1983, millions continue to choose Intuit's software over that of its competitors. Intuit’s huge ecosystem of financial products like Quickbooks, TurboTax, Credit Karma and connections with numerous financial institutions enables Mint to build its market dominance. As said by founder of Wesabe, Marc Hedlund, “Mint focused on making the user do almost no work at all, by automatically editing and categorizing their data, reducing the number of fields in their signup form, and giving them immediate gratification as soon as they possibly could, we completely sucked at all of that.”

## Technology:

**All finances in one place solution:** 
\
Mint uses account aggregation technology to securely downloads transaction data by connecting to more than 16,000 US financial institutions.
Prior to Intuit’s acquisition, Mint used to provide account aggregation through Yodlee. Currently they are using Intuit’s own developed proprietary aggregation technology that guarantees access to secure, anonymous transactional data and complements Mint’s categorization engine of users spendings in minutes. 

**Categorization engine:** 
\
Mint categorizes transactions on daily basis based on the supplier’s name and/or how you have categorized a similar transaction in the past. Mint uses Yellow Pages data, typically labeled according to SIC (Standard Industry Classification) codes for supplier’s name categorization service, which provides a means for finding businesses close to a particular location and identify the primary business of the establishment. Mint also uses machine learning technology in their categorization algorithm, for adding transaction categories of the data categorized manually by users.

**MintSights:** 
\
This feature gives meaningful, personalized insights and tips to help improve users financial health. Mint uses machine learning for MintSights to help understand patterns in people’s behavior and optimize how they manage their money, by creating budgets, consolidating debts, and growing investments.

**Data center:** 
\
Mint was originally hosted in an internal data center, but the team needed to improve its ability to scale up or down automatically without spending a lot of time and money acquiring and provisioning new servers to meet peak traffic demands and strong security capabilities. Mint has now completely shifted to optimizing its mint.com application with Amazon Web Services.

## Landscape:

Mint is a personal finance management platform that aggregates data from different accounts to give users a 360 degree overview of their financial situation. Personal Finance Management (PFM) software/apps contribute directly to bettering one’s financial literacy with help of artificial intelligence (AI), smart analytics, automation, and open banking. Top contributors to the PFM software/apps space can be categorized into three main divisions: 

1. **Neobanks:** This are digital only banks offering personal finance tools built directly into their mobile applications and website. *(Example: Chime, Varo)*

2. **Digital Wealth Managers:** They use technology such as machine learning and artificial intelligence to help consumers better understand their financial health and manage investment decisions. *(Example: Personal Capital, Lending club)*

3. **White-label Software Providers:** They allow financial institutions to integrate PFM software from a third-party directly into their platforms with the help of open banking under Software as a Service model(SaaS), so that customers can refine how they manage their finances. *(Example: Strands, Intuit Mint)*

Personal Finance management tools were acclaimed as the future of banking for over a decade. With digital revolution, large banks have been spending over $500 million a year on mobile IT costs. According to Allied Market research, Global PFM software market was at $795 million in 2016 and has reached to $1024 million in 2019. Demand in need to track & manage income of consumers along with surge in mobile application across the globe are two major factors that fuel the growth of the market. With startups and digital application providers offering personalized and advanced PFM features, traditional banks are being pushed to change their business models adapting open banking and add them to their services to win consumer’s loyalty. As stated by Business Insider, bank customers who make use of personal finance management tools on average are 18% wealthier than those who don’t. In this day and age people looking to improve their financial health have variety of options from traditional bank apps, to neobanks, or even a stand alone PFM service provider. PMF solutions have widely captured attention of younger, digitally native cohorts with its constant improvements in user experience, data sharing capabilities and effectively designed tools to simplify one’s financial health.

## Results:

Most companies in PFM domain measure their success based on number of users that signup to use their services. It is difficult to extract exact information on number of users that currently use Mint. Intuit does not disclose any figures for Mint separately, instead it bundles it with the company’s consumer sector services. However Mint has proven its demand in the market within just 2 years of its launch with 1.5 million users in 2009, when Intuit Inc. decided to acquire the company. With over 20 million users in 2016, mint.com website and Mint’s PFM app for Android and iOS, became a great contribution to Intuit’s family. Intuit recorded 13% increase in total consumer segment service revenue in fiscal year 2020, compared to 2019 figures. But it has to be noted that most of that revenue can probably be attributed to TurboTax and Intuit’s SaaS products for tax preparation. As of now, Mint benefits from lack of serious competition and being forefront in the online PFM tool platform. Most of Mint’s competitors require an annual subscription or monthly fee and the free web apps like Personal Capital are more aimed at offering Investment management services.

## Recommendations:

According to me, Intuit Mint lacks service in two major areas that could capture huge market space of its top competitors making it #1 customer’s choice in PFM domain: 

- Automated Savings: Mint’s services are limited to determining saving targets and analyzing saving amount in a given budget period. It does not automatically set aside savings for you in a savings or investment account. 
- Investment Advise: Unlike Mint’s top competitor - Personal Capital, Mint does not provide direct investment advice or assistance. It only connects users to financial service provider and offers comparison and brokerage recommendations. This is Mint’s least interactive and informational area.

These services are not new but already offered by Mint’s competitors. The automated saving feature can be implemented by creating automated savings algorithms that analysis user’s income and spending patterns and move aside set amounts of money from paychecks into savings accounts on a regular basis or round-up purchases to the next dollar and deposit the spare change into a savings account. Using Intuit’s integrations and partnership with market leaders like Wealthfront, investment advisor tool can be implemented through robo-advisor algorithms along with dedicated human financial advisory team. As per the predictions, over 80% Americans would bank digitally, rather than going to a branch, making Robo Advisors and Digital Investing new norm. Mint in addition to above mentioned features can help its customers with all-in-one financial management needs from tracking and categorizing spendings, to creating interactive budgets, monitoring credit scores, automated savings as well as providing investments advice.
